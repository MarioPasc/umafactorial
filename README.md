## About the Practice

This repository includes exercises on the following branches:

- `main`: The main branch where the initial setup and basic functionalities are introduced.
- `refacIO`: A branch where input/output methods are refactored.
- `recursivo`: A branch dedicated to implementing a recursive approach to the factorial calculation.

Each branch represents a step in the learning process, showcasing different Git commands and best practices.

## How to Use This Repository

To explore this repository, you can clone it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarioPasc/umafactorial.git
```
Once cloned, switch between branches using git checkout to see the implementation details:
```bash
git checkout branch-name # replace 'branch-name' with 'main', 'refacIO', or 'recursivo'
```
## Learning Outcomes

Through this practice, you will learn about:

- Initializing repositories and making initial commits.
- Branch management and the purpose of separate branches.
- The process of refactoring code and committing changes.
- Merging branches and resolving any merge conflicts.
- Pushing local changes to a remote repository.
